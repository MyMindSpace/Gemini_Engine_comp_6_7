2. **Context Activation**: Retrieve and format relevant memories for response
3. **Gemini Integration**: Send structured prompt to Gemini API with context
4. **Response Enhancement**: Improve response quality and consistency
5. **Follow-up Planning**: Identify opportunities for continued engagement

### Proactive Engagement
1. **Pattern Analysis**: Monitor user activity and emotional patterns
2. **Trigger Identification**: Detect check-in opportunities (stress, events, patterns)
3. **Message Generation**: Create contextual proactive messages
4. **Timing Optimization**: Schedule delivery based on user availability patterns
5. **Response Handling**: Process user responses to proactive engagement

## Gemini Integration Strategy

### Prompt Engineering
- **System Prompt**: Define AI personality and behavioral guidelines
- **Context Section**: Recent memories, emotional state, personal preferences
- **Conversation History**: Last 5-10 exchanges for continuity
- **Current Message**: User's latest input with appropriate formatting
- **Response Guidelines**: Specific instructions for tone and content

### API Management
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect Gemini API limits with intelligent queuing
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when API is unavailable
- **Cost Optimization**: Balance response quality with API usage costs
- **Response Caching**: Cache similar responses for efficiency

### Quality Control
- **Response Validation**: Check for appropriate content and tone
- **Consistency Checking**: Ensure responses align with established personality
- **Safety Filtering**: Screen for inappropriate or harmful content
- **User Satisfaction**: Monitor response quality through user feedback

## Response Enhancement System

### Quality Improvement
- **Coherence Checking**: Ensure responses logically follow from context
- **Personality Consistency**: Maintain stable AI personality across conversations
- **Emotional Appropriateness**: Match response tone to user's emotional state
- **Information Accuracy**: Verify factual claims against user's known information

### Follow-up Generation
- **Question Crafting**: Create natural, human-like follow-up questions
- **Topic Development**: Deepen conversations on important subjects
- **Memory Integration**: Reference relevant past conversations naturally
- **Engagement Optimization**: Encourage continued meaningful dialogue

## Technical Implementation

### Context Management
- **Template System**: Structured prompt templates for consistent formatting
- **Token Counting**: Precise token usage tracking for budget optimization
- **Context Pruning**: Intelligent removal of less relevant information when needed
- **History Compression**: Summarize old conversations to preserve context

### Performance Optimization
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking API calls for responsive user experience
- **Response Streaming**: Stream responses for immediate user feedback
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache context assemblies and frequent responses
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute API calls across multiple endpoints if available

## Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: <3 seconds for complete conversation processing
- **Context Assembly**: <500ms for optimal context preparation
- **API Integration**: <2 seconds for Gemini response including processing
- **Proactive Timing**: Deliver scheduled messages within 1-minute accuracy

## Quality Metrics
